            <li><span class="ingredient-quantity">350g</span> spaghetti</li>

            <li><span class="ingredient-quantity">2 plump</span><span class="ingredient-name"> garlic</span> cloves 
                peeled and left whole</li>

            <li><span class="ingredient-name">sea salt</span> and 
                freshly ground <span class="ingredient-name">black pepper</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="content-titile" >Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>

            <li>Finely chop the 100g <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span>, 
                having first removed any rind. 
                Finely grate 50g <span class="ingredient-name">pecorino cheese</span> and  
                50g <span class="ingredient-name">parmesan</span> and mix them together.</li>
             
            <li>Beat the <span class="ingredient-name">3 large eggs</span> in a medium bowl and 
                season with a little freshly grated <span class="ingredient-name">black pepper</span>. 
                    Set everything aside.</li>
             
            <li>Add 1 tsp <span class="ingredient-name">salt</span> to the boiling water, add 350g<span class="ingredient-name"> spaghetti </span> and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>

            <li>Squash 2 peeled plump <span class="ingredient-name">garlic</span> cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>

            <li>While the <span class="ingredient-name">spaghetti</span> is cooking, 
                fry the <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span> with the <span class="ingredient-name">garlic</span>. 
                Drop 50g <span class="ingredient-name">unsalted butter</span> into a large frying pan or wok and, 
                as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span> and
                <span class="ingredient-name">garlic</span>. </li>

            <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the 
                <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span> is golden and crisp.
                The<span class="ingredient-name"> garlic</span> has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>

            <li>Keep the heat under the <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span> on low. 
                When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and 
                put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
                Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and 
                don’t throw the<span class="ingredient-name"> pasta water </span>away yet.</li>

            <li>Mix most of the<span class="ingredient-name">  cheese  </span>in with the<span class="ingredient-name">  eggs </span>, 
                keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>

            <li>Take the pan of<span class="ingredient-name"> spaghetti </span> and 
                <span class="ingredient-name">pancetta</span> off the heat. 
                Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 
                Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the<span class="ingredient-name"> spaghetti </span> so it 
                mixes easily with the<span class="ingredient-name"> egg mixture</span>, 
                which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li>

            <li>Add extra<span class="ingredient-name"> pasta cooking water </span>to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
                You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>

            <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. 
                Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. 
                If the dish does get a little dry before serving, 
                splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li>
