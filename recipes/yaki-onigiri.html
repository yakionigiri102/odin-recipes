    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A favorite at izakaya restaurants, Yaki Onigiri are Japanese rice balls that are pan-grilled and glazed in savory soy sauce. 
        With a crispy crust on the outside and tender rice on the inside, these rice balls are simply irresistible and easy to make at home!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese short-grain rice (cooked)</li>
        <li>Seasonings: soy sauce, sugar, salt, and sesame oil</li>
        <li>Soy sauce glaze: soy sauce and sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Combine the cooked rice and the seasonings. Mix it all together without making it mushy.</li></p>

        <p><li>Finely chop the 100g <em>pancetta</em>, having first removed any rind.
            Finely grate 50g <em>pecorino cheese</em> and 50g <em>parmesan</em> and mix them together.</li></p>

        <p><li>Make onigiri with seasoned rice. Iâ€™ll show you two ways in this recipe: using an onigiri mold and plastic wrap. You can choose either method.</li></p>

        <p><li>In a frying pan lined with parchment paper, place the rice balls and grill on all sides on medium-low heat until crispy and golden.</li></p>

        <li>Brush the soy sauce glaze on the rice balls and sear the brushed surface. Be careful not to burn.</li></p>
